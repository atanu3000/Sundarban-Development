# Sundarban-development
The Sundarban Development Project uses PHP for managing the technical aspects and MySQL for storing data. It has two main sections: one for administrators to control and supervise the project, and another for regular users to participate and contribute. The project aims to promote sustainable development and conservation in the Sundarban region.
